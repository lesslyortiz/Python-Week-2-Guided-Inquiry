# MEDIUM: Create a program that accepts a number (1-12) as input and logs to the console that number and its corresponding month. For example: if the user enters the number 3, then it should return the month “March.” Alert the user if they enter an invalid number (e.g. less than 1 or greater than 12).

    print("January")

    print("February")
elif imput == 3:
    print("March")
elif imput == 4:
    print("April")
