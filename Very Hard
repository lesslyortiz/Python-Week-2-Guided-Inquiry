# VERY HARD: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return “The input is not on this list”
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
# Hint:  Use a function. Use the built in method .index( ) and/or for loops. Review your lesson on Arrays to aid in working through this problem. 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: 3 is not in this list



def findtar(arry, tar):
    index= arry.index(tar)
    return(index)

print(findtar([4,2,7,0], 4))
